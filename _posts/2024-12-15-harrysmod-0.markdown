# tldr; harrysmod
If you're on this site you're likely wondering where HarrysMod has dissappeared to. Unfortunatly, it wasn't finanically viable to run the server anymore. I'd stopped working on it once I got a job and left it to the remaining staff, who did an excellent job of keeping it alive with semi-frequent updates and balance changes. Things change though, and in 2024 Garry's Mod just doesn't really have the appeal that it used to do.

# So what's next?
These days I have a [real job making cool video games](https://youtu.be/w6TJTHdgmts), however, In 2025 I'm going to be releasing the source code to HarrysMod for free on github. I'm going to do some deep dives on the code I wrote and highlight the terrible mistakes I've made, but also reflect on some of the stuff that I still find cool today.

# Can I set up my own HarrysMod with it?
Sure! But please don't ask me for any help with it. I also won't be providing any user data that we gathered over the years. If you use it to build cool stuff, let me know!

# I have more questions!
If you've got questions about HarrysMod please send me a message on discord (meharryp).

### Thanks for reading!
If you got this far, here's a few early videos from when I was fist building HarrysMod
